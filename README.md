# ResponsivePortfolio-hw2
Homework2: The purpose of this assignment was to be able to use bootstrap to minimize the use of media queries and to create a mobile responsive "About Me" portfolio. We were provided with screenshots of an already created portfolio that served as a reference for our work and we didn't necessarily had to make ours look like the examples provided which I belive it gave us room to use our creativity and allowed us to express a little bit of our style in our own portfolio, I personally incline towards minimalistic and simple designs which is perfect as I need more practice in CSS. Using bootstrap made it easy to create a personal website from scracth because it offers a wide variety of examples and resources that are useful for begginers like myself. However, I did encounter a few challenges throughout this project that I still need to fix, some of these challenges included the use of CSS as mentioned before, adding images with appropriate sizes that do not overlap with each other or in some cases one looks bigger that the other and I get stuck on how to fix it, and finally after having trouble with adding a Contact Form I was able to do some research on my own and add it to my page.
In conclusion, this project help me get familiar with bootstrap and explore the many functions, including bootrtap components and grid system to be able to create a mobile responsive application.
